# AiMs-Synergy-Tracker ![release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v4.0.0-blue.svg)

#### Description
The purpose of this Addon is to show if there currently is a synergy cooldown active and how long it takes to run out.
It's possible to adjust the tracker frame without having to reload your ui.
Furthermore as of Version 3.8 the core of this Addon has been pretty much entierly rewritten to ensure flexibility with further features.
